    symptoms:
      'Symptoms of viral infections include: Fever, Muscle ache, Fatigue, Coughing, Sneezing, Runny nose, Watery eyes, Sore throat, Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea, Loss of appetite, Rash, Depression, Irritability, Hallucinations, Paralysis, Coma, Death',
    transmission:
      'Viruses can be transmitted in a variety of ways. Some viruses can spread through touch, saliva, or even the air. Other viruses can be transmitted through sexual contact or by sharing contaminated needles.

Humansâ€™ relationship with bacteria is complex. Sometimes they lend a helping hand, by curdling milk into yogurt, or helping with our digestion. At other times they are destructive, causing diseases like pneumonia and MRSA.',
    symptoms:
      'Symptoms of bacterial infections vary depending on the type of bacterial infection, the area of the body that is infected, and other factors, such as age and health history. Symptoms may include: swelling, redness, or pain, pus or fluid, fever, chills, fatigue, skin rash, and muscle aches.',

This means that their cells have a nucleus. They also have cell walls, which are made of chitin. Fungi are heterotrophs. This means that they cannot make their own food. Instead, they get their nutrients from other organisms. Fungi are decomposers. They break down dead organic matter and return nutrients to the soil. They also help plants absorb water and nutrients from the soil.',
