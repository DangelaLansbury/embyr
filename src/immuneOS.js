    description: 'A virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism. Viruses infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.',
    symptoms:
      'Symptoms of viral infections include: Fever, Muscle ache, Fatigue, Coughing, Sneezing, Runny nose, Watery eyes, Sore throat, Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea, Loss of appetite, Rash, Depression, Irritability, Hallucinations, Paralysis, Coma, Death',
    transmission:
      'Viruses can be transmitted in a variety of ways. Some viruses can spread through touch, saliva, or even the air. Other viruses can be transmitted through sexual contact or by sharing contaminated needles. Insects including ticks and mosquitoes can act as "vectors," transmitting a virus from one host to another.',
    treatment: 'Treatment of viral infections focuses on supportive care, such as getting enough rest and drinking plenty of fluids. Antiviral medications that inhibit viral reproduction are available for some viral infections.',

      'Bacteria are microscopic, single-celled organisms that thrive in diverse environments. These organisms can live in soil, the ocean and inside the human gut. Humansâ€™ relationship with bacteria is complex. Sometimes they lend a helping hand, by curdling milk into yogurt, or helping with our digestion. At other times they are destructive, causing diseases like pneumonia and MRSA.',
    symptoms:
      'Symptoms of bacterial infections vary depending on the type of bacterial infection, the area of the body that is infected, and other factors, such as age and health history. Symptoms may include: swelling, redness, or pain, pus or fluid, fever, chills, fatigue, skin rash, and muscle aches.',

  fungus: {
    name: 'fungus',
    description:
      'Fungi are one of the five kingdoms of life. They are neither plants nor animals. Instead, they range from mushrooms to yeasts, to molds and even mildews. Fungi are eukaryotic organisms. This means that their cells have a nucleus. They also have cell walls, which are made of chitin. Fungi are heterotrophs. This means that they cannot make their own food. Instead, they get their nutrients from other organisms. Fungi are decomposers. They break down dead organic matter and return nutrients to the soil. They also help plants absorb water and nutrients from the soil.',
